it is a program that takes the speed of cars as input and prints a feedback
#TEST
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints: "Ok".
If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, it calculates and prints the demerit points for every 5 km/s above 70 km/h. 
If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints: "License suspended".
